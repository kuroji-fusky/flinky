Q: Why is there no login and stuff?

A: Simple: it boils down to cost and technical maintenance. While it has benefits of having the freedom for anyone to create a listing, it's just a hobby project. In hindsight, adding a login feature *this* early can be beneficial, but at the same time, it can burden the technical costs of maintaining and moderating such a feature that would otherwise have low-ish traffic (for now, at least).

Please understand that this is just a one-man project. If anything, it makes my life easier to review submissions from other people and have common sense for others look at the [Guidelines](/guidelines) on what goes in and what doesn't. If there's enough bandwidth to warrant a login feature, then maybe I'll consider adding one in the future.
