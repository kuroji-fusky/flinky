# {title}

*Flinky* is a crowd-sourced curation site about cataloging real, notable, and *fluffy* anthropomorphic characters from all sorts of consumer media, with a clear source trail and proper context—no fan-made knockoffs, no *real* animals, and certainly no "THIS MY OC, DON'T STEAL!" entries.

> In short, here's the gist of it:
> 
> - ✅ A character *should* have animalistic/anthropomorphic features
> - ✅ Must be tied to a brand or reputable IP and have a decent amount of media presence
>   - ✅ Corporate anthro characters are also permissible as along it's not a generic logo
> - ❌ It shouldn't be any one else's fursona that's used as their personal avatar
> - ❌ It also shouldn't be a modified or recolors from an existing character(s)
> - ❌ Character(s) that are fabricated that may otherwise lead to a conflict of interest

## 1. Characters that *strictly* show animalistic traits

A character should have the following:

- Show some form of sapience and some tangible form of communication (verbally or gestures)

### 1a. Anthro-Adjacent Franchises (Pokémon, Digimon, etc.)

WIP

### 1b. Corporate mascots

Characters such as *Tony the Tiger*, and *Octocat* are allowed since a mascots purpose is to support the brand or a company.

#### Examples

| Character      | Brand/company |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Tony the Tiger | Kellogs       |
| GEICO Gecko    | GEICO         | 
| Octocat        | GitHub        | 


## 2. Notability

A character should also have a certain level of notability in order of being accepted in Flinky. There's no specific criteria of how "famous" a character is, it should be in the bare minimum of nicheness and also being in a tangible medium (e.g. TV, games, books, comics, etc.)

Tracking a *verifiable* source of the character increases the likelihood of it being in the db and it should be one or more of the following:

- Official websites, including ones from the Wayback Machine if the official site is down
- News coverage, press releases
- Interviews or posts from a creator[^1]
- Various social media updates from a creator[^1]
- Platform listings from monetized platforms (e.g., Steam, Kickstarter, Nintendo eShop, GoFundMe, etc.)

[^1]: A creator can be an individual, a group, or a studio; sometimes even a distributor, if eligible.

Optionally, a character should have a backstory or narrative arc, therefore making a character notable.

### 2a. Citing *Fandom* wikis

Citing sources from a community-based wiki farm like Fandom, can be a double-edged sword; on one hand, it can provide substantial data about the character or franchise in question, but, in some wikis, a lack of citation or proper sourcing to back claims of such, thus citing Fandom wikis dubious - especially challenging info that needs citation.

## 3. Fan-Made and AU (alternate universe) content

Fan-made characters aren't allowed; especially to characters that belong to oneself, especially when used as an avatar, this includes:

- **Fursonas**: These are used as a self-expression and are not qualified
  - Notable figures in the furry fandom (i.e. Majira Strawberry, BetaEtaDelota, Pocari Roo, etc.) *do* have a certain level of notability, but they're aren't elligible to be in the list.
- **Edits of existing characters**: Whether your character is an altered version of *Sonic* or *Nick Wilde*, isn't allowed either.

This is to prevent conflict of interest or potential bias that would raise issues, and Flinky "clean" and aim to target to a general audience as much as possible.

## 4. Special exceptions

WIP

## Bottom line

Make sure you do your due diligence and verify the character's existence by doing a background check and to ensure that it's not fabricated in any way - preferably backed up by its source material and it only takes more than just screenshots.
