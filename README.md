## Setup

### Prerequisites

To get this project running, you'll need the following:

- Docker
- Go v1.23.7 or higher
- Node 22 or higher (LTS recommended)
- PNPM package manager
  - If you don't have PNPM installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`, you'll immediately have it installed when you run the `pnpm` command.

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> Installing the dependencies can work the other way around. (i.e. installing the server dependencies first, then frontend, vice versa)

Install the frontend dependencies by running:

```console
pnpm install
```

From the `server` directory, run:

```console
go get download
```
